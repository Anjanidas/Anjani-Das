        <p><i>Having old friends is such a blessing that not everyone has this blessing. Friends of school times are the one with whom we have spent all our childhood and that we know eachother from a very long period. Those friends are very rare to find as very less people in this world know you from your childhood and has seen you growing or has grown up along with you and that is where the understanding develops between people.</i></p>
